    <h3>My Artistic Journey</h3>
    <p>
        Since I was young, I loved anything that had to do with creating things. I did different types of art, from drawing and painting 
    to DIY crafts. I have created many things, from paintings with acrylic paint to painting my own house and building my own closet.
    You could say I have tried different mediums of art, which allowed me to find my love for drawing and painting.
    </p>
    <p> 
      This is what sparked my interest in tattooing, but it led me to fall in love with another form of art. Giving someone a beautiful 
    art piece they want that will last practically forever, really brings a lot of joy in my life.
   </p>
    
  <h3>Why tattoos?</h3>
   <p>
      Tattoos can be memories, milestones or part of one's identity. Tattoos can carry a deep meaning to someone or it could just be a form of 
    artistic expression, simply an image that they enjoy. Regardless, it will be on one's body for a lifetime.
   </p> 
   <p> 
      I'm not saying that other mediums of art won't last, but carrying it on your body is truly a special type of expression. Tattoos have so much
    meaning just from the memory of it, marking a time in someone's life when they were adding to their identity. If the image is meaningful to the 
    individual, it's even more special! I love being a part of creating something special and unique for each client.
