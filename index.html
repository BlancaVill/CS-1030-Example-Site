    <h2>Since I was young, I loved anything that had to do with creating things. I did different types of art starting with drawing to painting 
    to DYI crafts. I have created many things from paintings with arcylic paint to painting my own house and building my own closet.
    You can say I have tried different mediums of art also, allowing me to find my love for drawing/painting. This is what sparked my interest 
    in tattooing,  but it led me to falling in love with another form of art. Giving someone a beautiful art piece they wanted that will last for 
    practically ever, really brings a lot of joy in my life.</h2>
