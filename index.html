    <h2>My Artistic Journy</h2>
    <p>Since I was young, I loved anything that had to do with creating things. I did different types of art starting with drawing to painting 
    to DIY crafts. I have created many things from paintings with acrylic paint to painting my own house and building my own closet.
    You can say I have tried different mediums of art also, allowing me to find my love for drawing/painting.
    </p>
    <p>This is what sparked my interest in tattooing,  but it led me to falling in love with another form of art. Giving someone a beautiful 
      art piece they wanted that will last practically forever, really brings a lot of joy in my life.</p>
  <h3>Why tattoos?</h3>
   <p>Tattoos can be memories, milestones or part of one's identity. A tattoos can carry so much meaning to someone or it could just be a expression of art 
     for them, simply just an image that they enjoy, but it will be on one's body for a lifetime. Not saying that other mediums of art won't last, but 
     carrying it on your body is defintely a special type of art form.
     With that being said, I believe that a tattoo has so much meaning just from the memory of it. It is a time in someone life when they were adding to 
     thier identity, regarless of the image. If the image is meaningful to the individual, it's even more special!
     I love being apart of creating something special and unique for each client. </p>
